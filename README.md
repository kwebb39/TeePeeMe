<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>Imagine going into a restroom stall and doing your business. All is well until you reach for the toilet paper, only to find out that there is none left. You make this face <strong>(;-;)</strong>. We are living in the twenty-first century. There should be no reason why this is still happening. This is a common problem that needs a solution. </p>

<h2>What it does</h2>

<p><strong>TeePeeMe</strong> senses when a roll of toilet paper is low and notifies the person in charge of TP duty. </p>

<h2>How we built it</h2>

<p>We used a light sensor and a LED light attached to an arduino 101 to demonstrate our design. Ideally, the sensor would be wireless and paper-thin. It would slip into the toilet paper roll. Once the toilet paper is used to the specified limit and is exposed to light, the sensor goes off and notifies the system. </p>

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>

<p>At first we wanted to use a depth sensor to estimate the radius/thickness of the toilet paper roll but there were no depth sensors. 
Then we wanted to use a color sensor to determine whether the toilet paper roll was white or brown but there were no color sensors. 
Then we got a light sensor and a LED light but couldn't connect it to the arduino 101. :(</p>

<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>

<p>Completed what we intended to do. </p>

<h2>What we learned</h2>

<p>Help is everywhere on Slack. 
How to use new technology. </p>

<h2>What's next for TeePeeMe</h2>
